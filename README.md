## Pipeline process
the circle ci run pipeline by running build jop then deploy
# build job
first install the dependencies for frontend and backend by running npm install command 
  "frontend:install": "cd notes-frontend && npm install ",

# deploy job
it runs : "deploy": "npm run api:install && npm run frontend:install &&  npm run frontend:deploy"

which run : "api:deploy": "cd notes-api && npm run deploy"
and : "frontend:deploy": "cd notes-frontend && npm run deploy",


api:deploy runs : "deploy": "eb init --region us-east-1 --platform Node.js notes-api && eb use notes-api-dev && eb deploy"

while frontend:deploy runs : "deploy" : "aws s3 cp --recursive --acl public-read ./build s3://notesbucket1234/"
